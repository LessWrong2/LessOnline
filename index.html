        <h2>Pricing</h2>
        <div>
          <p>We determine pricing on a case-by-case basis, but a good approximation is:</p>
          <p>
            <b>Retreats and Conferences:</b><br/>
            $100 - $250 per person per day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Parties:</b><br/>
            $25 - $75 per person.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer some groups large discounts (including free) if we think a project seems particularly great to us. Please feel quite free to ask us about this.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use your own caterer, but our default caterer offers meals from $20/meal to $50/meal that most visitors have found quite satisfying.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do engage in some price discrimination. If we think your best alternative to our venue would be much more expensive, we may charge more than our listed price. We try to find a fair price that splits the difference between our own costs and the value you get out of the space. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We also provide more bespoke services (see below), though we generally charge more for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall we try to be reasonable about pricing, and don't expect to make much profit on the space.

        <div class="text-section buildings">
          <p>
            The campus has seven buildings in total. Six are oriented around a central courtyard, and one is a block away, great for additional sleeping.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Atrium</b> is the largest building. Downstairs is great for parties and weekend conferences, but usually isn’t available during weekday business hours (since that’s where the Lightcone team and collaborators work from). The upstairs has a rentable common space and 7 bedrooms that you can use for retreat or conference sleeping.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Bayes House</b> is almost as big as the Atrium. With a total of 20 bedrooms, it can host sessions of up to 60 people. The walls are covered with whiteboards. The rental includes the surrounding gardens, which can easily fit 200+ people with various nooks and breakout spaces.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Cottage</b> is primarily used for storage and laundry. You can use it to store supplies for your events.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Den</b>. The back of this building has 4 of our nicest and most secluded bedrooms, while the front of the building has 7 offices and event spaces you can use for your event.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Extension</b> has 4 session spaces, a fully-equipped gym, and a large session space fitting up to 60 people.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Farmhouse</b>. Surrounded by beautiful gardens and a nice outdoor bar, use this as the hub for one of your retreats.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>The Guesthouse</b>. A house less than a block away with 10 additional bedrooms, available to be used for sleeping and private diners for any of the events hosted at Lighthaven.
