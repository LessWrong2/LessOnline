                <p>We don&rsquo;t know yet, we&rsquo;re still putting the schedule together, so stay tuned.
                </p>
                <p>Would you like to run a session? <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4B77tccoWHweSxAW31OV3Yi9F3kG74zJxwT0kfbOtXq1YuQ/viewform"><b>Let us know with this form.</b></a> 
                </p>
                <p>Here are the sorts of things we&rsquo;d love people to run:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Debates: </strong> Present arguments for a claim that you’ve thought a lot about, and argue against someone who disagrees with you about it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Read us a new story that you’ve written.</li>
                    <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> Give a workshops on a skill you’ve had practice with — statistics, forecasting, investigative journalism, story-writing, anything you know well and people might be interested in.</li>
                    <li><strong>Talk w/ Q&A::</strong> If you have talks you’ve given before or have one you’d like to give to this audience, we’d like to hear it!</li>
                    <li><strong>Memo Sessions:</strong> This is where someone has written a short essay (2-6 pages) ahead of time, then a small group of people reads it, and then has a Q&A with the author about the ideas in the essay. It works best if the author defends a strong or surprising claim that some people in the room will clearly disagree with.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Make music: </strong> Bring your instrument and have a jam, or lead a singalong, or host a dance session.</li>
                    <li><strong>…Something else?</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Over the weekend, there will be a continuously updating collaborative schedule for sessions that anyone is invited to add to.</p>

                <p>Lots of bloggers and fiction authors, plus some Manifold Summer Camp attendees, and however many hundreds of people apply for a ticket that we can fit. My guess is 400 people.</p>
                <p>And hopefully you!</p>
