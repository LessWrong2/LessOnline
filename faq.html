                    <p>Would you like to run a session? <a

                    <p>Here are the sorts of things we'd love people to run:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Debates: </strong> Present arguments for a claim that you've thought a lot about,
                            and argue against someone who disagrees with you about it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Read us a new story that you've written.</li>
                        <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> Give a workshops on a skill you've had practice with —
                            statistics, forecasting, investigative journalism, story-writing, anything you know well and
                            people might be interested in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Talk with Q&A:</strong> If you have talks you've given before or have one you'd like
                            to give to this audience, we'd like to hear it!</li>
                        <li><strong>Memo Sessions:</strong> This is where someone has written a short essay (2-6 pages)
                            ahead of time, then a small group of people reads it, and then has a Q&A with the author
                            about the ideas in the essay. It works best if the author defends a strong or surprising
                            claim that some people in the room will clearly disagree with.</li>

                        <li><strong>Make music: </strong> Bring your instrument and have a jam, or lead a singalong, or
                            host a dance session.</li>
                        <li><strong>… Something else?</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Over the weekend, there will be a continuously updating collaborative schedule for sessions that
                        anyone is invited to add to.</p>
